My solutions to algorithm contests.

Google Code Jam problems:
Some of my selected Google Code Jam solutions.

Codeforces problems:
codeforces/CONTEST_NAME/PROBLEM_LETTER contains the solution to the problem PROBLEM_LETTER at https://codeforces.com/contest/CONTEST_NAME/problem/PROBLEM_LETTER
Example: codeforces/833/D/D.cc contains solution to Problem D at https://codeforces.com/contest/833/problem/D

Topcoder problems:
topcoder/PROBLEM_NAME gives the solution to the problem PROBLEM_NAME.
You can look up the problem statement by putting searching the problem name by "Class Name" at https://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=ProblemArchive

Atcoder problems:
atcoder/CONTEST_NAME/PROBLEM_LETTER contains the solution to the problem PROBLEM_LETTER at CONTEST_NAME.contest.atcoder.jp/assignments
Example: atcoder/arc100/E/E.cc contains solution to Problem E at arc100.contest.atcoder.jp/assignments

Contest bookcode:
Some bookcode for standard algorithms that I wrote.

Note: My solutions sometimes uses template bookcode for some standard algorithms (eg. Fast IO, FFT, Max-flow, 2SAT) that is not originally written by me. This is typically the exception rather than the rule -- most of the code here is written by me.
